# Replacement verification

2026-10-21 UTC, macOS development host.

Passed:

- Android: six offline protocol/security tests; APK debug build and lint (warnings remain).
- Android: live bootstrap decrypts AirVPN's explicit refusal of a synthetic invalid account.
- Rust: four offline protocol/security tests, all-target build/test, strict Clippy.
- Rust: separately enabled live invalid-account bootstrap test.
- Tests cover RSA session wrapping, AES/association interoperability, official
  manifest parsing, group inheritance, entry indices, IPv6 endpoints, missing
  devices, account mismatch, XML entity rejection and profile directive injection.
- Android debug APK installed separately as `me.vwave.vpn.dev`, preserving any
  existing production installation.
- GitHub API confirms both legacy repositories remain private and archived.

Not verified:

- Android UI runtime: opening the app returned `DEVICE_IN_USE` because another
  agent-device session owns the emulator. That session was left alone.
- Authenticated account flows and actual WireGuard connections on either platform.
- Linux privileged worker, Hummingbird integration, firewall/DNS cleanup and
  disconnect/crash behavior. Rust compilation on macOS is not Linux runtime testing.
- Leak protection, split-tunneling interactions and feature parity with old apps.

Repeat locally:

```sh
./gradlew :core:test :app:lintDebug :app:assembleDebug
WAVE_LIVE=1 ./gradlew :core:test --rerun-tasks
```

```sh
cargo test --all-targets
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --test protocol live_bootstrap -- --ignored
```

Live tests use only made-up credentials. No real user credentials are required.
Rust's macOS dependency `block 0.1.6` currently emits a future-compatibility warning.

After the repository split, each app was checked from its own repository root.

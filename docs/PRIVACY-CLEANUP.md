# Published history privacy

Both GitHub repositories were subsequently deleted and recreated under their
existing names from the cleaned main branch and release tag. The new repositories
do not inherit the old pull requests. The cleaned commit/tag identities and
signed release asset bytes were preserved. Private rollback backups remain
outside the published repositories.

On 2026-11-03, published branch/tag history and release packages were sanitized.
Lab access details were generalized and recorded VPN exits were replaced with
documentation addresses. Test timing, outcomes and known failures were retained.
Old commit identities were normalized to the public project identity in the
rewritten history. No credential or private-key exposure was confirmed.

The v0.1.0 APK bytes and signing certificate are unchanged. Source/documentation
packages were sanitized and restored with a fresh signed checksum manifest.
Download the current archives, checksums and signatures together; do not mix an
old manifest with a new archive. Package provenance
retains the original binary build revision and identifies the cleaned source
revision separately. This cleanup is not a new build or qualification result.

Release packaging now uses public archive ownership and removes local project
and home paths from generated build records.

Existing clones can retain the old history. Re-clone or carefully rebase local
work onto the rewritten branches; do not merge old history back into the project.
GitHub may retain read-only PR references and cached commits until server-side
cleanup is completed. Rewriting branches alone does not purge those copies.
